## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to reflect a sense of professionalism and depth. It suggests competence and creativity, aligning with Mayur's dual role as an SDET and freelancer.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a very desaturated version of the primary, to provide a subtle and clean backdrop that keeps focus on content.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), chosen for its contrast against the indigo and lavender, helps to draw attention to calls-to-action and interactive elements. The bright saturation makes the design elements pop.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a sans-serif with personality suited for the site sections headers, and 'Alegreya' serif font for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean, professional icons for skills, certifications, and contact information.
- Implement a modern and responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Incorporate smooth scrolling and subtle hover effects for an engaging user experience.
